"""TLS trust for Apple endpoints.

Some Apple services - notably ``gsa.apple.com`` - present certificates that chain
to Apple's own roots, which are not present in public trust stores (``certifi``)
nor, on many machines, the OS store. Rather than disabling certificate
verification (a real MITM risk on the password-bearing auth flow), we pin Apple's
CA chain and verify against a combined bundle: the standard public roots from
``certifi`` plus Apple's root + intermediate. This keeps every request
authenticated and works on any machine regardless of its trust store.
